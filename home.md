Quick reference coding notes for:

- C++ (WIP)

- Java (Planned)
- Rust (Planned)

## Resources:

- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) is an incredible resource
for understanding topics in Computer Science. I will refer to images and 
examples provided by GeeksForGeeks throughout these notes since they are
incredibly well done.


- [CPlusPlus](https://www.cplusplus.com/) is a really handy reference page that
tells you how functions and pieces of code native to C++ work. Often times I
will link or refer you to their page to better explain things.
